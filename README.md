## Notice

This fork is meant to allow zfetch usage on zig 0.10 (a.k.a. stage2, a.k.a. 
self hosted compiler). The original author has deprecated/archived their
zfetch package, recommending [haze/zelda](https://github.com/haze/zelda).
However, I find it useful to have a version that doesn't depend on libressl,
and the changes necessary to make this work on zig 0.10 were minimal.

I do not intend to keep this updated with master, but will update it for
official zig versions.

A HTTP request library for Zig with HTTPS support.

## Features

* HTTPS support, including trust handling (provided by [iguanaTLS](https://github.com/alexnask/iguanaTLS))
* A relatively simple interface.

## Notes

* Passing `null` as the `trust_chain` in Request.init will tell zfetch to **not check server certificates**. If you do
  not trust your connection, please provide a iguanaTLS x509 certificate chain.
* zfetch only does rudimentary checks to ensure functions are called in the right order. These are nowhere near enough
  to prevent you from doing so, please call the functions in the order they are intended to be called in.

## Adding zfetch as a package

### Gyro

```zzz
# gyro.zzz

...

deps:
  truemedian/zfetch: ^0.1.1

...
```

### Zigmod

```yaml
# zig.mod

...

dependencies:
  - type: git
    path: https://github.com/truemedian/zfetch

...
```

### Submodules

> Assuming zfetch is **recursively** checked out at `libs/zfetch`

```zig
// build.zig

const zfetch = @import("libs/zfetch/build.zig");

...

exe.addPackage(zfetch.getPackage(b, "libs/zfetch"));

...
```

## Examples
